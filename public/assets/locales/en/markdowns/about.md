## Why Infectieradar.be?
We know that many people who become infected with the new coronavirus have mild or few symptoms and do not go to the doctor. Also, not everyone is tested. This make it difficult to track how the new coronavirus is developing in Belgium. With the help of people from all over the country this can be done better, and together we can keep a close watch on what is going on.

## How does Infectieradar.be work?
People who have registered as participants in Infectieradar report once a week to Infectieradar whether they have had a fever or other symptoms in the past week. This allows us to monitor how health complaints are distributed in Belgium and how the situation develops over time. We can use this data for scientific research into the spread of the new coronavirus. In the future, that research will also be useful for other viruses and infectious diseases.
Participants receive an initial registration form with questions about their background: work, age, and existing diseases and conditions. Following this they receive an email every week asking if they have had any symptoms in the past week and if so, which ones: a runny nose, coughing, sneezing, a high temperature and so on. It is important for the questionnaire to be completed even if a participant has no symptoms. If this is the case, it takes about 30 seconds to answer the questions; if there are symptoms it takes about 3 to 5 minutes.
